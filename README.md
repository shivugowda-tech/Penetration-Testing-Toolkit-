Penetration Testing Toolkit – Python

Built a Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit that brings multiple security testing techniques into a single modular framework.
The toolkit helps simulate real-world attacks and understand how vulnerabilities can be identified during a penetration test.

✨ Key Features

Port scanning and service enumeration

Brute-force attack simulation (for learning)

Modular and extensible architecture

Focus on ethical hacking principles

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

socket

itertools

🎯 Objective
To design a practical toolkit that strengthens understanding of penetration testing methodologies while reinforcing ethical and responsible security testing.

📚 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with penetration testing concepts

Improved understanding of attack simulation

Enhanced Python scripting for cybersecurity

🔒 Use Case
Suitable for cybersecurity labs, academic projects, and ethical hacking practice in controlled environments.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This toolkit is developed strictly for educational purposes and must only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
